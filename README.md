# freeCodeCamp Responsive Projects 

## Cheese Ball Landing Page 
This was initially a project for freeCodeCamp but as I got involved I went on to change some design elements and saw the necessity for bootstrap and started to develop the project from there.

## Tribute 

The first project of the responsive projects. A simple website made as a tribute to some person that's fully responsive.

## Survey 

A small responsive survey that gets some information using all of the possible fields.

## How to use

Simply open the project folder that you wish to see and open the .html file in your favorite browser.
